Your task is to rewrite the user's query to broaden the search scope for a travel itinerary assistant in Hanoi. The goal is to retrieve diverse location types (food, cafes, entertainment, culture, workshops, check-in spots), not just restaurants.

ORIGINAL QUERY:
{original_query}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. IDENTIFY THE INTENT:
   - Case A (Specific Query): User asks about a specific place ("Pho Thin o dau"), price, or factual info. -> ACTION: Keep the query focused. Fix typos or add district name for clarity only. DO NOT add "cafe", "check-in", etc.
   - Case B (Broad/Itinerary Query): User asks "Di choi Cau Giay", "An gi o Ba Dinh", "Len keo 500k". -> ACTION: Broaden the search as per step 2 below.

2. FOR BROAD QUERIES ONLY:
   - Expand to include: "Quan an ngon", "Quan cafe dep/chill", "Dia diem vui choi", "Check-in", "Workshop".
   - If budget is mentioned, add keywords like "gia re", "sinh vien".

3. IF USER MENTIONS A SPECIFIC STREET/LANE (e.g. "ngo Tu Do"):
   - Prioritize keywords for that specific micro-location.

4. Output ONLY the rewritten query in Vietnamese.
